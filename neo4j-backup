The video covered the basics of what the students will be learning over the next several weeks as they delve into the clowning world. A form of entertainment that has been around for more than a thousand years, clowns were once known as court jesters. <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON> said the first step is to learn how to move like a clown. While most people walk and move smoothly, clowns exaggerate their movements, which is important so that people know exactly how they are feeling. Although they will have time to practice later, the students also learned the basics of juggling, which includes starting out with something like a light handkerchief, which will fall slowly. <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON> said as that becomes easier, begin trying with soft bean bags, which won't roll away if dropped.", "\"The bottom line is practice,\" said <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON>. Last night's video also showed the basics of balloon art, clown gags and skits and designing costumes. The students also learned there are three different kinds of clown make-up faces, the white faced clowns, which are the more reserved clowns. Auguste clowns, which have both white and flesh tones, are the roust-abouts and trouble makers, said <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON>. The third type of clown is the tramp or character clown. Clothes are determined by what kind of clown a person chooses to be. <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON> said that if his students choose to be a tramp or character clown he wants them to dress nicely instead of in old rags. The key to developing a face and costume is to exaggerate already existing physical characteristics, such as height, length of face and girth. When developing a clown face, the basic circus colors used are red, black, white and blue. Clowns use color on their lower lip only and smiles are generally smaller, not the big scary smiles often created by inexperienced clowns, said <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON>. Using baby powder, clowns set their make-up so it doesn't run. \"We use plain old baby powder as long as it doesn't have cornstarch in it,\" said <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON>, adding that they brush off excess powder with a brush. \"After I get my make-up on I can go swimming and it won't come off,\" said <PERSON>Waggoner</PERSON>.

It is also a day when voters get a chance to voice their opinion on the fate of various ballot measures. This year the ballot measures gave voters a chance to decide on the fate of everything from the presence of electronic scratch tickets at licensed non-tribal gaming establishments to the creation of an education trust fund in the state. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, voters came out in force and let their feelings be known.", "Initiative 872 When it comes to the creation of a new primary election format, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> voters overwhelming voted for change. In <LOCATION>Yakima County</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>67.8 percent</PERCENT> of voters approved the initiative. This mirrors the response from voters across <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state, where <PERCENT>59.9 percent</PERCENT> voted for the initiative. The initiative gives voters a chance to vote for all candidates in a primary election with the top two candidates moving on to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. Those opposed to the initiative were concerned that the two-top primary could result in a single party election in some races come <DATE>November</DATE>. According to the <ORGANIZATION>State of Washington Voters</ORGANIZATION>' pamphlet, the passage of I-872 could mean lowering the annual cost of the primary election system by as much as <MONEY>$6 million</MONEY> from the system currently in place.

These numbers nearly mirror the results statewide, where <PERCENT>60.74 percent</PERCENT> of voters decided against the initiative. Those against the initiative pointed to the fact that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is already the seventh highest taxed state in the nation and already has one of the highest sales tax rates. Those for the initiative felt it would help provide additional funding for the state's education system. If the measure had passed it would have increased the state sales tax, which currently sits at <PERCENT>7.5 percent</PERCENT>, by <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT>. This new revenue would have been put aside to help support education throughout the state.

Initiative 892 <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, voters flexed their muscles and voted down Initiative 892, which dealt with electronic scratch ticket machines. The initiative would have made it possible for authorized, licensed non-tribal gambling establishments to bring in the same type of gaming machines used at tribal casinos. According to the initiative, the revenue brought in from the additional gaming machines would have been used to reduce state property taxes. In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state, <PERCENT>60.63 percent</PERCENT> of voters marked no on their ballots, leading to the defeat of the measure.

Referendum Measure 55 The second education measure on the ballot didn't fare much better than the first. <DATE>Tuesday</DATE>, voters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> voted down Referendum Measure 55, which would have made it possible to establish charter schools in the state. The measure would have made it possible for charter schools to be operated by \"qualified non-profit corporations, under contracts with local education boards.\"", "The charter schools would have been allocated a certain amount of public funds for operation. Again, the percentage of voters who voted against Referendum 55 in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state is almost exactly the same as the percentage of those who voted against it in <LOCATION>Yakima County</LOCATION>. Across the state, <PERCENT>58.42 percent</PERCENT> of voters voted against the measure. In <LOCATION>Yakima County</LOCATION>, <PERCENT>58.77 percent</PERCENT> of voters voted against it. <PERSON>Jim Spady</PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Charter School Resource Center</ORGANIZATION> noted that he feels the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> education system is currently in crisis. \"We must do more to help our educationally disadvantaged students,\" <PERSON>Spady</PERSON> said. \"Charter public schools will help these children, but the voters have apparently decided to give the regular public school system more time to solve this crisis on its own.\" Initiative 297 One measure voters across the state turned out to support was Initiative 297, which deals with radioactive hazardous waste at the <ORGANIZATION>Hanford Nuclear Reservation</ORGANIZATION>.

BRUNELL Selling change is always difficult, but when it involves public schools and our kids' education, it is daunting at best. Dr. <PERSON>Rod Paige</PERSON> is President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s Secretary of Education and the chief architect of \"No Child Left Behind.\" Surprisingly, he is the first superintendent of schools to hold that post. <PERSON>Paige</PERSON>'s father was a public school principal, his mother a public school librarian.

For example, without a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, there is no way to know if a person has high blood pressure and to monitor it to ensure that treatment is working. The same goes for education-you need tools and measurements to make informed decisions. Paige also believes test scores are a measure of where students have problems, and he rejects the notion of averaging school and district test scores as an indicator of progress. \"No Child Left Behind\" is not about averaging the scores of high performers and low achievers.", "It is about ensuring that kids don't fall through the cracks, passed from grade to grade unable to master the skills they'll need to succeed in the real world. For example, studies show that if a student cannot read proficiently after the third grade, their problems in school only compound. He encourages parents to read to their children and have their children read to them. \"No Child Left Behind\" also sets aside federal funds for tutoring students from low income and disadvantaged families. <PERSON>Dr. Paige</PERSON> reminded his audience that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has increased education funding by nearly <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> since the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> Administration left office. He also was quick to point out that funding for K-12 is the state's responsibility and the federal government supplements, not supplants, that support.", "Finally, <PERSON>Paige</PERSON> unabashedly supports school choice and charter schools-highly unpopular with the teachers' union. He believes all students and parents should have choices, not just the families who can afford to send their children to private schools. Being on the front line, battling for change is a tough job even with less volatile issues, but <PERSON>Dr. Paige</PERSON> has handled his job well. Americans should be grateful there are dedicated educators like <PERSON>Paige</PERSON> because their persistence will keep our country competitive and full of opportunity.

She explained that the <LOCATION>Yakima Valley</LOCATION> chambers are working together to organize a 10-day festival that will attract those who are visiting the area for <ORGANIZATION>Spring Barrel</ORGANIZATION> tasting to stay and enjoy what the <ORGANIZATION>Valley</ORGANIZATION> has to offer.

Corliss explained that local businessman <PERSON>Tom Denlea</PERSON>, who recently opened the <ORGANIZATION>Best Western Grapevine Inn</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION>, brought the idea of a Valley-wide festival to the forefront after observing the Tulip Festival that takes place every year in the <LOCATION>Skagit Valley</LOCATION>.

She said the <ORGANIZATION>Spring Fling</ORGANIZATION> festival can serve as a way for the communities in the <LOCATION>Yakima Valley</LOCATION> to take advantage of the many visitors who come into the area for <ORGANIZATION>Spring Barrel</ORGANIZATION> tasting. Corliss admitted that when planning for the festival first started, the different communities involved were a little territorial. However, as time has gone by the communities have realized that working together is what is important when it comes to making the festival a success. \"It has been a great process,\" <PERSON>Corliss</PERSON> said.", "At this point, <PERSON>Corliss</PERSON> said the group of chambers involved in coordinating the <DATE>Spring</DATE> Fling festival are working on preparing the calendar of events.

The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has had a plan in place since <DATE>2001</DATE> to create a charter school district of as many as ten troubled schools, but opposition from the <ORGANIZATION>School Board</ORGANIZATION> and the teachers union stopped the plan dead in its tracks. But with <PERSON>Capdau</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> finally got its chance to try a different approach. The changes came swiftly. Using a <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> donation from a local bank, the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> gave the neglected school a fresh coat of paint, repaired leaky ceilings and installed new lights to brighten its dark and dingy hallways. Next, the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> hired a veteran local principal with a get-tough reputation, replaced all but one of <ORGANIZATION>Capdau</ORGANIZATION>'s teachers, and implemented a new curriculum that tailors instruction to each student. The idea is to help students learn at their own pace, rather than promote them to the next grade whether or not they'd learned the material. As with <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state's education reforms, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> wants to make sure its high school diplomas are more than just a record of attendance.", "With the curriculum in place, the search for students and teachers began. More than 500 students applied for the 264 spaces available at the school. Students were selected by lottery from applicants who lived within a five-mile radius of the school. The grandmother of two students selected for Capdau told state and school officials that the school takeover was the answer to her prayers. Teachers were not as impressed. Applications to work at <ORGANIZATION>Capdau</ORGANIZATION> came in slowly. Soured by years of failed school reform efforts, teachers were wary of signing on to yet another experiment in education reform. Eventually, <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials overcame their concerns, and more than 60 teachers applied for 16 available teaching positions. At a training session two weeks before the start of school, teachers were warned to discard their old ideas.", "\"Perception is reality,\" the trainer warned, and if they expected their students to be unruly and incapable, the students would respond to those expectations. \"I want you to grab those perceptions,\" said the trainer, \"and toss them on the floor.\" Of course, the teachers aren't na ve; they understand the difficulty of their challenge.

Amongst the educational priorities Grabenhorst outlined were a focus on amply funding K-12 education. He suggested the state complete a comprehensive review of the finance system and establish a sustainable, predictable and fair state funded system for public schools. Making a constitutional amendment that would allow school districts to pass a levy with a simple majority is also key to better education in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, said Grabenhorst. He asked the state legislators to consider repealing unfunded mandates, which are difficult to implement without funding in place. \"We have requests that are set in front of our districts and no funding,\" said <PERSON>Grabenhorst</PERSON>.", "He also asked the legislators to oppose binding arbitration and to reinforce the state's \"no strike\" laws. <PERSON>Sen. Honeyford</PERSON>, in his opening comments, said one of the major issues facing the legislature this budget cycle is money. \"We'll have at least a <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> deficit, plus collective bargaining. We'll probably be a billion-two upside down to start with,\" he said. He explained that K-12 education receives about <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> of the state's budget and another <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> goes to higher education. Corrections receives about <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT>, leaving the state with about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the money as discretionary. Honeyford said they have had difficulties getting the votes to make strikes illegal, but they are still working on it. He said he believes that questions about the <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION> will once again return to the state level this next year. \"The <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION> to some people is the holy grail to end education problems,\" said Honeyford. \"I don't like it. It's terribly expensive for what we get.\" Another concern is non-English speakers and the disabled taking the test.", "Chandler takes a different view on the test. He believes there has to be some kind of benchmark or test to see the educational growth. \"I believe at the end of the day most students will achieve our expectations of them,\" he said. \"If we expect great things they will rise to that.\" He added that he believes there is a lot to be said for better than average students. <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> said a K-12 task force has been looking at education in the state and one of the areas it found of interest is special education funding. \"In areas some districts are making money on it and others are in the hole,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. Chandler said if Initiative 884 going before voters to help fund public education is passed it will be the highest tax increase in the history of the state. He said that if the initiative fails that most likely the legislators will be reluctant to increase taxes. \"If it passes it will probably be the only tax increase passed mainly because of its size,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. A concern <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> has with the initiative is that if the <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> increase in retail sales tax for K-12 education is put in a fund and decided upon by a citizen oversight committee, he foresees the legislature having very little input on public education.", "One of <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse</ORGANIZATION>'s main concerns is the class of <DATE>2008</DATE> being required to pass the <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION> to graduate. \"There's concern about the dropout rate if we don't do anything about it,\" said <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON>. But, some changes may be afoot at the state level. Currently, there are 25 Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and 24 Democrats. With four close races, Honeyford feels it's too close to call what it will be like next year. The <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> has 52 Democrats and 46 Republicans. \"That six-vote difference was determined in the last election by 1,700 people,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. \"This year we expect voter turnout to exceed <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT>. Ten percent of voters in <LOCATION>Yakima County</LOCATION> could be new voters, which creates a lot of uncertainty.\" Local pastor and a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District</ORGANIZATION>'s ethics committee, <PERSON>Ron Jetter</PERSON>, addressed the trend to combat obesity at the school level by banning certain foods and beverages from school grounds. He asked if the legislators anticipate a state law that would ban certain foods. Chandler said that last year two bills in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> addressed child obesity. One of the bills would have banned certain foods from being sold on school grounds. The other, known as the \"Fat Tax,\" would have taxed foods based on ingredients. The problem, he said, is that some candy bars would be taxed and others wouldn't. Chandler anticipates at least one proposal this year, but he would much rather leave it at the school board level. In all, the legislators are looking forward to an interesting session.", "They said they appreciated the input from those who are on the front line of education, which helps them in their decision making process in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION>. The light at the end of the tunnel, Honeyford added at the end, is that the economic downfall the state has been experiencing is expected to end in <DATE>2009</DATE>. He anticipates programs that have been neglected with funding, such as education, will receive more funding. . <PERSON>Mel Sacher</PERSON> can be contacted at (509) 837-4500, or e-mail msacher@hawkpress.com"]})

In fact, the same census report found that those covered by employer provided coverage dropped to <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the population, down from <DATE>2003</DATE> numbers. This hits the minority community the hardest. Latinos and African-Americans account for more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the uninsured population-one out of every three Latinos is uninsured and about one out of every five African-Americans. The tax code has favored employer-provided health insurance for the last 60 years, and in that time, this important benefit has enabled most Americans to get health insurance from their employers. Workers who buy their own health insurance are the only people who don't get a tax break when and if they buy health insurance. This year, employer-provided and self-employed health insurance will enjoy a <MONEY>$155 billion</MONEY> tax break. It is fundamentally unfair that workers are discriminated against by the federal tax code in their purchase of health insurance simply because they buy a policy outside their place of employment. With the jump in the uninsured, surely there should be political momentum behind helping the uninsured get health insurance. But with the campaign season in full swing, the people who desperately need access to affordable health insurance will have to wait until after the next election to get any help at all, unless <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> does something right away.", "<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> could pass a bill now that would provide relief to workers. This bill, known as \"Fair Care for the Uninsured,\" would provide money for the purchase of health insurance-<MONEY>$1,000</MONEY> for an individual, <MONEY>$2,000</MONEY> for a couple, and <MONEY>$3,000</MONEY> for a family, each year. President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has provided funding for this money in his budget. Fair Care would correct the discrimination built into the tax code that currently gives unlimited tax benefits to those who purchase health insurance through their employer, but no tax benefit to the individual purchaser. The money provided under Fair Care would be advanced to workers up front so that they would have money to buy health insurance, and, according to <ORGANIZATION>Fiscal Associates</ORGANIZATION>, 18.6 million uninsured people could buy health insurance. During this presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee, Senator <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON>, has suggested other ways to help the uninsured, such as a tax break for small businesses, extending Medicaid to cover low-income children, and enabling workers to buy into health coverage programs for federal employees. However, in 19 years in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Mr. Kerry</PERSON> has not introduced legislation to address the uninsured crisis.", "But today he can change that by marching right down to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and adding his name to the Fair Care bill. He doesn't have to wait to make more empty campaign promises. He can make his dream to help the uninsured a reality by immediately supporting this bipartisan legislation. Perhaps it's because Senator <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> is worth <MONEY>$169 million</MONEY> and gets tax-free health insurance from the federal government. The <ORGANIZATION>Florida Times-Union</ORGANIZATION> indicated in a recent editorial that <PERSON>Mr. Kerry</PERSON> \"may not see it [the uninsured] as a problem. Admittedly, [Fair Care] would not appeal to those who want to turn health care entirely over to the government, hang the cost.\"", "Most politicians think reducing the number of uninsured is a good thing. Republicans and Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Congress</ORGANIZATION> think Fair Care is a good idea and support the legislation. National groups representing Hispanics, small employers and farmers support Fair Care. While some policymakers would like to consign a large number of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s working poor to Medicaid, or some expanded version of Medicaid in which individuals and families will only get the benefits government officials give them, <ORGANIZATION>Fair Care</ORGANIZATION> is a superior alternative, which would not bust the federal budget and continue to choke state budgets across the country.", "The best option is to change the tax treatment of health insurance and give low-income working families without health insurance money to help them purchase private health insurance best suited for their families. <PERSON>Robert de Posada</PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION>The Latino Coalition</ORGANIZATION> ( www.thelatinocoalition.com), a non-profit, non-partisan organization based in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>"]})

BRUNELL In <DATE>September</DATE>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON> vetoed legislation that would have raised that state's minimum wage from <MONEY>$6.75</MONEY> to <MONEY>$7.25</MONEY> per hour in <DATE>January</DATE> and <MONEY>$7.75</MONEY> in <DATE>2006</DATE>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Department of Labor and Industries</ORGANIZATION> announced that our state's starting wage will increase to <MONEY>$7.35</MONEY> starting next year. <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s minimum wage is already the highest in the country. It is no coincidence that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s unemployment rate is also among the highest in the nation. On an hourly basis, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s minimum wage will exceed <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> by <MONEY>25 cents</MONEY>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> by <MONEY>65 cents</MONEY> and <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> by <MONEY>$2.20</MONEY>. The truth of the matter is <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s new minimum wage is closer to <MONEY>$9</MONEY> an hour and, for some industries, is now over <MONEY>$10</MONEY> per hour because of employer payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance, Social Security and workers' comp. Unless <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s Legislature acts in <DATE>2005</DATE>, our minimum wage will automatically go up again in <DATE>2006</DATE>. These automatic increases were part of a union backed initiative that passed in <DATE>1998</DATE> which mandates annual cost-of-living increases in the minimum wage based on the federal Consumer Price Index for <ORGANIZATION>Urban Wage Earners</ORGANIZATION> and Clerical Workers. In other words, our state's minimum wage is pegged to wage-rates in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> without regard for regional differences in rural parts of the state. Take <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, Wa. for example. In <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>, the world's largest asparagus processing plant will close after next <DATE>summer</DATE>'s harvest because it cannot compete with cheaper Peruvian asparagus. Part of the reason is <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>'s high minimum wage. So, while <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> voters may have had the best of intentions when they passed the automatic wage increases, our high minimum wage has helped kill 50 full-time jobs and 1,000 seasonal jobs in <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION>. That's not what the voters had in mind. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, a state with a heavy dependence on agriculture, would also be hurt by a minimum wage hike. In vetoing the recent legislation, Gov. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> rightfully acknowledged that increasing the state's minimum wage makes it too expensive for employers to hire inexperienced workers or provide jobs for young people and seniors. And remember, small businesses create most of the jobs in this country. In essence, raising the minimum wage ever higher forces farmers and small businesses to cut jobs, replace workers with machines, or simply close up shop. The problem will get worse unless legislators take bold action next year to change the law. They need to do four things to change our state's minimum wage law before it further erodes our state's job base:1) Repeal the automatic cost-of-living increase and raise minimum wage rates only when warranted; 2) Freeze the minimum wage at <MONEY>$7.35</MONEY> until competing states catch up; 3) Treat the minimum wage the same way we treat prevailing wages in Washington-tie it to local economies; and 4) Establish a lower short-term training wage and a lower minimum wage for anyone under age 18 to encourage employers to offer job opportunities to disadvantaged and young workers. While increasing the minimum wage may have seemed like a good idea, it has ended up hurting the very people it was supposed to help. That's called \"the law of unintended consequences.\" Legislators need to change the law next session. <PERSON>Don C.

City of Alderwood officials, after several months of serious discussions with the <PERSON>Monson</PERSON> family, struck a deal to purchase the 150-acre feedlot for <MONEY>$2.5 million</MONEY>. The money will be paid in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the site. The money to be paid to the <PERSON>Monson</PERSON> family won't be generated by implementing local taxes or fees, or by asking local citizens to approve a bond measure.

At the present time, <LOCATION>Rockford</LOCATION> said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME>, the city has approximately <MONEY>$7 million</MONEY> tied up in invested reserves.

He said if property values were to rise too much, most people living in the area would be unable to afford the purchase of higher priced homes. <PERSON>Kenny Nelson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>DK Bain Real Estate Inc.</ORGANIZATION> agreed with <PERSON>Timmermans</PERSON> that residential property values probably won't rise in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION> as a result of the elimination of the dust and odor problems.", "\"But the quality of life will definitely be a major improvement,\" <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said emphatically. \"Maybe people will start looking at moving to Alderwood instead of looking to move into <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> or Zillah.\""]})

He said the state definition of a dropout refers to those students who leave school failing to graduate with their peers. \"Many of the students will continue their education in some other fashion,\" he said. For example, some students will return to school at <ORGANIZATION>PRIDE High School</ORGANIZATION>, the district's alternative school, and others will elect to earn their GED, he explained.", "\"I think schools are doing a better job of keeping kids in school by offering more support programs, which meet the needs of the non-traditional students. \"For those who don't work well in the regular classroom, we are offering a variety of alternative education and mentoring programs to help them to succeed,\" <PERSON>Vegar</PERSON> said.

The estimated high school drop-out rate for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> public schools students declined <PERCENT>6.7 percent</PERCENT> during the 2002-03 school year, down a full percentage point from 2001-02.

For some kids, earning that coveted high school diploma in four years is just taking longer, he said. A number of factors play into the disparity. \"For example, some teens drop out to work or have babies, only to return to school several months or a year later to resume their education. One area where the percentage rates are higher for dropout rates is at the state's alternative high schools.\" For example, <ORGANIZATION>PRIDE High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION> shows <PERCENT>45.3 percent</PERCENT> dropout rates, based on its 2003-04 school enrollment of 158 students.

In nearby <ORGANIZATION>Mabton School District</ORGANIZATION>, the dropout rate was listed at zero for the past year, while <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> reportedly had 50 students drop out of school, using the state formula. According to the OSPI figures, an estimated <PERCENT>65.7 percent</PERCENT> of the state's students graduated on time in <DATE>2003</DATE>, while another <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> remained enrolled to continue working toward their diploma.", "The estimated cumulative dropout rate for the state class of <DATE>2003</DATE> was <PERCENT>24.3 percent</PERCENT>. However, about half of those students termed as dropouts were students who could not be tracked after leaving school and had not yet earned a diploma.

Martin then commended the board on taking a proactive stance on parent involvement, noting that they are ahead of many districts when it comes to taking steps to actively include parents in their children's education. \"Family and school together, can help all students be successful,\" <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. Carrera added that although the opening of the parent center is a big step, the process of getting parents involved in school is ongoing.", "\"You've laid a great path and it's going to be an exciting journey,\" <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said. During the board retreat, <ORGANIZATION>Human Resources</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Debbie Holwegner</PERSON> and Payroll Officer <PERSON>Pauline Schut</PERSON> took time to walk the board through the 2004-05 salary schedules and agreements for the different positions in the district. As Holwegner and <PERSON>Schut</PERSON> showed some of the different salary schedules to the board members, Bones made some comments about some of the changes that have taken place in regards to the different salaries scheduled for the 2004-05 school year. He pointed to the salary schedule for classified administrators, which include positions like the transportation supervisor, noting that this is the first time there has been a salary schedule for these positions. He explained that in the past the different positions have each had their own salary range. This year all of those positions have been brought together, with all of the salaries also having been brought closer together and put in the same salary schedule. Bones said another change to the salary schedule involves principals in the district. Bones said principals have been year-around employees. He said this is because many principals were often found in their buildings in <DATE>July</DATE>, dealing with everything from new hires to getting things organized for the next school year.", "<PERSON>John Hughes</PERSON>, safe and effective schools director, took time to talk to the board about the upcoming <ORGANIZATION>Washington State Health Youth Survey</ORGANIZATION>, which is administered every two years to sixth, eighth, tenth and twelfth graders. Hughes said this year will mark the third time the test has been administered in the school district. Hughes said the test will be administered sometime between <DATE>Oct. 11</DATE> and 15. He added that the surveys are anonymous and voluntary, and deal with everything from bicycle safety to drugs and alcohol. <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> said the district has also been working on putting together a curriculum for younger students that deals with irrigation canal safety. He said the district received a <MONEY>$5,000</MONEY> grant from <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Power</ORGANIZATION> to work on the curriculum, which is being created with help from both kindergarten teachers and students. He told board members he is currently searching for an illustrator to draw the coloring books that will make up the curriculum. Bones then talked about different subjects the school board would like to bring up when they schedule a joint meeting between the board and city council. Bones said he would like to talk about different partnerships between the two entities and working to ensure that services are not being duplicated. He said the different subjects he would like to see discussed include looking at aligning all of the early learning programs in the community on the same page, working to get children ready to enter kindergarten. He said he would also like to see the subject of technology discussed, because technology is something that affects everyone in the community. As for the subject of adequate yearly progress, Executive Director of Instruction and Learning <PERSON>Gary Vegar</PERSON> said many of the schools in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION> are showing signs of making a lot of progress. However, schools in the district are still struggling to make adequate yearly progress.", "\"We just need to keep the course,\" Bones said, noting that the district has done a lot of work when it comes to literacy and trying to prepare students for the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Assessment of Student Learning exams."]})

The end result was a 35-14 victory over the hapless Ki-Be Bears. \"We cut our mistakes down from the <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION> game,\" said <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> first year coach <PERSON>Dustin Lamb</PERSON>. The new Greyhound coach said his players also took advantage of what Ki-Be gave them. \"Ki-Be loaded the box to take away the run from us,\" Lamb said. \"So we went to the air, and it worked.\"", "All told, a total of six receivers caught at least one pass against the Bears. Quarterback <PERSON>Brandon Artz</PERSON>'s favorite targets, though, were <PERSON>Kevin Concienne</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Vela</PERSON>. The duo combined for three touchdowns. Vela gained 153 yards on four receptions, and Concienne picked up 73 yards on his five catches. <PERSON>Ryan Dill</PERSON> also hauled in a TD pass from <PERSON>Artz</PERSON>, a 36-yarder that got <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> on the scoreboard first. Artz finished the night connecting on 11-of-17 passes, which netted 274 aerial yards for the 'Hounds. His four touchdown throws easily offset the one interception the Bears had against him. When <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> (1-0, 1-1) did go to the ground, it was senior <PERSON>Silas Hansen</PERSON> who took the majority of the hand-offs from <PERSON>Artz</PERSON>. Hansen put the punctuation mark on the game for the 'Hounds with his 3-yard touchdown run late in the <DATE>third quarter</DATE>. His short scamper gave <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> a 35-0 lead. Hansen finished with 50 hard fought yards, coming on 14 totes. Teammate <PERSON>J.R. Camacho</PERSON> added six rushing yards on four carries. Ki-Be, which was limited to 192 yards of offense, scored <DATE>two fourth quarter</DATE> touchdowns after Lamb began subbing freely from his bench. The win over the Bears came in <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Central Washington Athletic Conference</ORGANIZATION> league opener. <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION>, which was dropped from the 3A ranks to class 2A this year, is making its debut in the CWAC this season, after having played in the Mid-Valley League for several years. But if <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> fans think the 'Hounds are going to have a cakewalk through the class 2A CWAC this season, they might want to think again. Grandview hosts the perennially tough <ORGANIZATION>Connell Eagles</ORGANIZATION> this coming <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME>, and Lamb says his club has its work cut out for it.", "\"<PERSON>Connell</PERSON> is huge, and very physical,\" Lamb said. \"They nearly knocked off <LOCATION>East Valley</LOCATION> <DATE>last Friday</DATE>, and <LOCATION>East Valley</LOCATION> is the top rated 2A team in the state.\" To beat <PERSON>Connell</PERSON> the Greyhounds are going to have to win the war in the trenches, said Lamb. \"Our line is going to have to play big against <PERSON>Connell</PERSON>,\" he said. \"The game will either be won up front or lost up front.\" Lamb is hoping his linemen turn in as strong of an effort against the <LOCATION>Eagles</LOCATION> this coming <DATE>Friday</DATE> as they did against Ki-Be this past weekend. \"Our line did a super job of protecting <PERSON>Brandon</PERSON> (<PERSON>Artz</PERSON>) last <DATE>Friday</DATE>,\" he said. The defensive line of the 'Hounds also excelled against Ki-Be, especially defensive end <PERSON>Cody McMillen</PERSON>. Outside linebacker <PERSON>Chris Mejia</PERSON> turned in a strong effort, as well, for <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> against the Bears. The Greyhounds' defensive secondary might have played even stronger against Ki-Be, as they limited the Bears to just 49 passing yards. Vela, playing cornerback, had an interception for the 'Hounds, and <PERSON>Matt Emerson</PERSON> from the other cornerback slot also shined with excellent defensive run support."]})

The <ORGANIZATION>Washington State Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> is offering drivers education classes at <ORGANIZATION>105-D South Sixth St.</ORGANIZATION>, on the east end of the old driver licensing department, near the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION>'s executive office.", "According to <PERSON>Cristina Klatovsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Noemi Ortega</PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION>Washington State Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION>, the local non-profit organization was certified to teach drivers education classes at the beginning of <DATE>July</DATE> and by the end of the month the first set of classes was off the ground. The first question most people ask when they hear that the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> has taken on the task of offering drivers' training - is how does that fit in with what the organization is doing? Klatovsky admitted that when you first look at it there doesn't seem to be a connection. However, she explained that the Migrant Council started thinking about offering classes after a successful car seat program. She said during the car seat clinic parents bring their vehicles in to ensure that they are properly using car seats for their children. What the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> found out during the clinic is that although they were able to ensure that children were riding in cars safely, what they weren't able to do was ensure that the person driving the car had a driver's license or knew how to properly operate a vehicle. \"Talking to mom and dad we kept hearing, 'We don't have a license,'\" <PERSON>Klatovsky</PERSON> said. She added that driving without a license ends up not only being a safety issue for the person behind the wheel and their passengers, but also for everyone who uses the road.", "\"It seemed to be a problem of high priority,\" <PERSON>Klatovsky</PERSON> said. Ortega noted that upon further inspection the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> discovered there was no place for bilingual or monolingual Spanish speakers to learn about drivers training. She added that the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> driving school is the first bilingual certified driving school in the state of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. \"There is a huge need out there,\" <PERSON>Ortega</PERSON> said of bilingual drivers training. Klatovsky said when the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> was first thinking about taking on a driving school, thoughts were of helping prepare adult drivers to pass the tests necessary to receive their license. However, when the school opened its doors staff members were surprised by the number of youths who were signing up for the class. Klatovsky said the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> was fortunate enough to put two of its staff members, <PERSON>Gilbert Garza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abdon Valdez</PERSON>, through training and both were certified to teach both adult and youth drivers education classes in English and Spanish. Klatovsky said the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> driving school has been getting quite a few <PERSON>Granger</PERSON> students in its class, noting that <ORGANIZATION>Granger High School</ORGANIZATION> is no longer offering drivers education. She added that because there were so many <PERSON>Granger</PERSON> students in the first class, the <ORGANIZATION>Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> actually had to run a van up to <PERSON>Granger</PERSON> every day to pick up the students and bring them to class.", "Klatovsky explained that even though there are quite a few youths taking advantage of the local driving school, there are also a number of adults who are turning out to gain a better understanding of the rules of the road. There are class times set up, but the schedule is very flexible and allows for one-on-one instruction. Someone who can't make it in during the regular class time or who doesn't necessarily feel comfortable in a setting like that, can come in whenever their schedule allows and go through training. Although the driving class is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Washington State Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Klatovsky</PERSON> said it is open to the entire community. Klatovsky added that it is a private pay program. The cost of the class is <MONEY>$85</MONEY> for the classroom training and <MONEY>$225</MONEY> for the behind-the-wheel training. She noted that the driving school currently has two state certified vehicles for use in the behind-the-wheel training.", "For more information about the <ORGANIZATION>Washington State Migrant Council</ORGANIZATION> driving school call 1-800-478-2219 or 837-2525."]})

A member of three different economic development boards, New Vision, the <ORGANIZATION>Yakima Valley SEID Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Resource Conservation Development Commission</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Camay</ORGANIZATION> has been on the front lines of economic development. He said as a member of the <ORGANIZATION>SEID</ORGANIZATION> board he has had a hand in <LOCATION>Lower Valley</LOCATION> projects, including the nursery in <LOCATION>Mabton</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> distribution center in <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION>.", "The <ORGANIZATION>Resource Conservation Development Commission</ORGANIZATION> has assisted in developing the <LOCATION>Toppenish</LOCATION> Highway tourist radio station. Camay has also favored the restructuring of the county's permitting and planning departments to develop a one-stop-shop for those looking to develop or build in the county. He said the county is offering a money-back guarantee to ensure that permits and plans are processed in a timely manner. A touchy subject, the new county jail, which is currently under construction in <LOCATION>Yakima</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Camay</ORGANIZATION> addressed club members' concerns saying that he did not make the decision in a vacuum. Lower Valley sites in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Grandview</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Toppenish</LOCATION> were considered by a citizen siting committee, but ultimately, after the county purchased land in <LOCATION>Toppenish</LOCATION> that didn't have water rights. Yakima was chosen as the site for the new jail. County Commissioner <PERSON>Jesse Palacios</PERSON>, who was also at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Club</ORGANIZATION> meeting, said that they were told by <ORGANIZATION>Toppenish City</ORGANIZATION> officials through the process that the land had water rights. But there are two different kinds of water rights. The land had rights for how much water flow was allowed in a year, but now for how much water could be pumped in a day, said <ORGANIZATION>Camay</ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Yakama Nation</ORGANIZATION> brought the water issue to the county commissioners' attention during the SEPA process. Camay added that he believes the Yakima fairgrounds location was the best for the county. Although one of his opponents vows to stop construction on the jail if elected, <ORGANIZATION>Camay</ORGANIZATION> said stopping the jail project would cost the county <MONEY>$5 million</MONEY>.", "Palacios explained that bonds were sold to build the facility. If the county were to stop the project the bonds would still have to be repaid. \"The revenue from the jail is supposed to pay for the bonds,\" he added. Since <DATE>1994</DATE>, the county has been able to gain <MONEY>$53 million</MONEY> from jail bed sales, said <ORGANIZATION>Camay</ORGANIZATION>. Looking to the future he said it will cost the county <MONEY>$27 million</MONEY> just to house its own population. \"The bottom line is we had to build anyway. This way we don't have to pay for it,\" said <PERSON>Camay</PERSON>, who agreed that although the jail numbers and costs are just projections, he felt it best to be prepared. Palacios said that the commissioners would have been criticized either way. He said if they didn't build the jail when they had the opportunity they would have been criticized in the future when the need was great.", "\"In the long run I believe it will save us money,\" <PERSON>Palacios</PERSON> added. Camay said that the siting committee was down to one site in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION> that looked feasible, but the cost to purchase the property and help <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood</ORGANIZATION> with a sewer system upgrade was not cost effective. \"I think that's (the sewer system) part of the reason Alderwood wanted us to come-as a solution to their problem,\" said <ORGANIZATION>Camay</ORGANIZATION>. Former <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood City Councilman Chad Werkhoven</ORGANIZATION> further questioned Camay on the jail project, asking why the county commissioners were not at a meeting billed as a public hearing, which was held in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Werkhoven</PERSON> said that the citizen siting committee was on-hand, but made it very clear that they had no intention of siting the jail in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION>. \"It turns out it wasn't a public hearing, it was a dog and pony show,\" said <PERSON>Werkhoven</PERSON>.

Plesha explained that even if the district ends up not receiving the grant it is something that had to budgeted for, just in case the district is selected. Also increased this year is the number of students expected to walk through the doors of the schools that make up the <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District</ORGANIZATION>.

Often times when there is an increase in the number of students, there is also an increase in the number of teachers and other school staff members, and this year is no different. The <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District</ORGANIZATION> plans to employ 364 certified staff members and 230 classified staff members. This is an increase of seven certified staff members over last year, and an increase of 10 classified staff members.", "Plesha noted that this year's budget reflects only a few small raises for district staff members holding certain positions. He explained that the state allowed for a <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> pay rate increase for classified staff members. Plesha also pointed out that teachers will be receiving anywhere from no raise to a <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> raise this year depending on how many years they have been teaching and whether or not they earned any college credits over the past year. Plesha noted that the state also granted no raise for administrators this year. When it comes to the capital projects fund, Plesha explained that the entire amount of the bond issue recently passed by voters is included in the <MONEY>$11.4 million</MONEY> budget. Plesha said this year money from the capital projects fund will help get the new middle school project started. The new school is expected to be constructed on land located along Washout Road. Plesha said although the entire amount to the bond is in the budget, he is only expecting to spend about <MONEY>$3 million</MONEY> this year. The transportation vehicle fund is also seeing an increase in funding this year. According to the budget, the fund totals <MONEY>$784,600</MONEY>, compared to <MONEY>$767,000</MONEY> last year. This year the debt service fund shows a slight increase over last year. This year total expenditures are budgeted at <MONEY>$1.8 million</MONEY> compared to <MONEY>$1.31 million</MONEY> last year.

Scores are given on a scale of 1 to 36 with 36 being the best possible score. \"Our students earned scores from 13 to 29,\" said <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON>. Mirroring the national increase in participation, more <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> graduates are choosing to take the ACT. \"We are seeing more of our students taking the ACT,\" <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said.

She had done nothing wrong. The only crime she committed was living on the west coast of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> during World War II.", "When the Japanese bombed <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 7, 1941</DATE>, the world changed for <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON> and others like her. People who had moved from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> decades earlier were suddenly being accused of spying for their home country. \"You're a traitor, more like a spy. Why, because you're Caucasian or African American or Asian or European or <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION>. There have been allegations against 'your people,' not Americans, but the people [who] share your skin color, of spying. You might not have known, but it's safer to put all of 'you' away, just in case, since color and ancestry, not personality, determines whether you are trustworthy or not. \"This is basically what President <PERSON>Roosevelt</PERSON> said to all people with at least 1/16 Japanese blood living in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, western <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, western <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION>, citizen or not, in <DATE>February of 1942</DATE> in Executive Order <DATE>9066</DATE>,\" writes <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth Church</ORGANIZATION>, a student in <PERSON>Irene Wells</PERSON>'s class at <ORGANIZATION>Discovery Lab School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Yakima</LOCATION>.", "The students in <LOCATION>Wells</LOCATION>'s class spent an entire school year researching the experiences of Japanese Americans during the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' involvement in World War II. The middle school students interviewed Japanese Americans who lived in the <LOCATION>Yakima Valley</LOCATION> during that point in history, read books about relocation centers and visited museums to learn about the experience. <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON>, one of the women interviewed by the students for the project, said during the taped interview that she remembers calling the relocation centers, concentration camps. \"Relocation center is a nice term for concentration camps,\" <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON> said in the tape. <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON>, who was born in the <LOCATION>Yakima Valley</LOCATION> and grew up in <LOCATION>Wapato</LOCATION>, told the students that her father came to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1905</DATE>, with her mother following in <DATE>1912</DATE>. She said her mother grew up in a privileged family in <LOCATION>Kobe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, leaving it all to live with her husband in the brush land of eastern <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. \"You can't imagine what it was like in <DATE>1912</DATE>,\" <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON> said.

She noted that once the Japanese began to arrive in the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>, they started to isolate themselves. She said the Japanese immigrants couldn't speak English, ate different foods and had their own traditions. She told the students that isolation meant they could speak to each other in their own language and eat familiar foods, making it feel more like home. \"It was a small community within a larger community,\" she said. <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON> told the students that the Japanese community in the <LOCATION>Yakima Valley</LOCATION> had their own clubs and churches. She said the <ORGANIZATION>Japanese Methodist Church</ORGANIZATION> was established in the early <DATE>1920s</DATE> and the Japanese Buddhist Church was established in the early <DATE>1930s</DATE> in <LOCATION>Wapato</LOCATION>. One of the reasons Japanese immigrants settled in the <LOCATION>Yakima Valley</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Kondo</PERSON> said in the tape, was because people coming from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> were not given the right of citizenship, which meant they were unable to purchase land.

Antonio said during the discussion it became apparent that many of his classmates felt that at some point in their lives they had been bothered because they were different. He said there were a wide range of things that came up during the discussion.

He added that on average every business in the state spends <MONEY>$7,000</MONEY> per employee, per year just to stay in compliance with federal regulations. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said he has talked to farmers and business owners throughout the state in regards to their concerns about federal regulations. He said one farmer in particular stood out in his mind, a <LOCATION>Kittitas County</LOCATION> farmer who told him a that it isn't the fact that a government agency, like the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION>, comes out to his farm and tells him what is wrong that bothers him.", "Instead, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> told members of the local Republic club, what bothered this farmer was the next step in the process. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the government agency then steps in and tries to tell that farmer just how he is going to bring his farm into compliance, regardless of the cost or the effectiveness of the method. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said that farmer told him that he feels he should be allowed, with his own ingenuity, to figure out how to come into compliance without a government agency giving him step-by-step instructions. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said this is where relief from federal regulations would come in. He explained that it would give farmers and other business owners a chance to work with government agencies to fix any problems that might come up, instead of being forced to work under them. \"We do not create a climate of trust,\" <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said about the current system. \"We need regulatory relief so [businesses and farmers are] no longer the bad guy,\" he added. Davis then took time to talk about the federal deficit.", "\"We have to begin to reign in federal spending,\" <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. He said the way the federal government is currently spending will ultimately cripple the next generation of Americans. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said it is his belief that things like social security can still be saved, noting that people should be given a chance to take a chunk of their money and put it into personal accounts, allowing them to save for the future. When it comes to a constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage, <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> told members of the local Republican club that it is something he supports. \"Children need to be loved by both a mother and a father,\" <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. He then pointed to research that suggests children need to have a family that consists of a mother and a father. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the current situation, where courts across the country are making the decision of whether or not same-sex marriage is legal, is not the proper way to go about things. He said he feels that anything less than a constitutional amendment in regards to same-sex marriage, \"...will be nothing more than a stop gap.\"", "Davis also took time to talk about his support of the <ORGANIZATION>Black Rock Reservoir</ORGANIZATION> project. \"In this state the farming community really wants one thing - water,\" <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said. \"I think the most important thing you need is water.\" Davis is running against Rep. <PERSON>George Nethercutt</PERSON> for the Republican nomination to run for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat currently held by <PERSON>Murray</PERSON>. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION>Maple Valley</LOCATION>, is an associate professor at <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Pacific University</ORGANIZATION>, where he teaches classes on political science.

Culver graduated as part of the Operation Recognition program, which allows military veterans who left school early to join World War II ranks to receive high school diplomas. As a part of the ceremony Culver not only received his diploma, but a long-awaited standing ovation from the crowd. Culver's recognition set the tone of the event, at which both <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones</ORGANIZATION> and class speaker, <ORGANIZATION>American History</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CWP</ORGANIZATION> teacher <PERSON>Monty Johnson</PERSON>, encouraged the young graduates to be part of their communities and vote. Bones also encouraged the graduates to, no later than <DATE>Saturday</DATE>, sit down and think about what their goals are and to raise them. \"It's important to set your goals high because you can do it,\" said Bones. \"You are successful. Don't be afraid to fail or challenge your future.\" Johnson addressed the class saying, \"You're the sons and daughters of this community. Take pride in yourselves. We have invested in you and we have invested well.\" He said there is much that faces the graduates as they leave <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood</ORGANIZATION> and enter the world. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said as <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood</ORGANIZATION> thrives and grows local residents will try to better it with our own interests in mind, to draw back some of the recent graduates. He encouraged the youths to become a part of their community, whether it be Alderwood or another town. He encouraged the youths to find a community and become a volunteer, join a service club or help a friend in need. \"Don't consider your education complete,\" he said, encouraging the young adults to be constant learners, informing themselves about what is going on in the world around them. He also encouraged the youths to participate in the country's democracy.", "\"Many of you are 18, or soon will be. I encourage you to vote this <DATE>fall</DATE>,\" said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>. He added that to vote and not know what you're voting for is worse than not voting at all. \"I know the world holds a lot for you,\" said <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>. \"So be informed, participate in the process and never ever sell yourselves short.\" Also speaking at the graduation were salutatorian <PERSON>Amy Kilian</PERSON> and co-valedictorians <PERSON>Stacey Gorski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joshua Barr</PERSON>. <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said as an eighth grader she was sick a lot and her grades began to slip. In danger of getting a C, she went to her teacher to beg for a better grade. In her mind, <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said, the sky turned black, the teacher sprouted devil horns and bellowed down on her NO!, when in fact that was all in her mind. In reality, <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said, when she was in eighth grade she was able to get a B in the class she was afraid she would get a C in and it was the last B she ever got. <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said memories are just fact-perception and image.", "\"Scientists have proven that you choose how you remember things,\" said <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON>. <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said she will always remember the funny moments with her classmates, including the slow-motion portions of the drama club's presentation of <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. She said if her fellow classmates' memories include <PERSON>Miss Schuette</PERSON> sending them home because their shorts had a 2\" inseam, they probably shouldn't wear those shorts to a job interview.

As a second grader, <PERSON>Barr</PERSON> remembers being punished for reading ahead, which almost squelched his interest in education. \"Teachers,\" he said, \"Your job is not just to guide your students though a series of lessons. Don't worry about what they'll learn next year, there are always things to learn.\" <PERSON>Barr</PERSON> said that through his life, God has been his strength. \"He has been my shield, my rock and my saviour,\" he said. <PERSON>Gorski</PERSON>, an award-winning science fair contest participant, examined the class of <DATE>2004</DATE> as if it were a science fair project. She said the class of <DATE>2004</DATE> science fair project would be called \"Driven, Determined and Dedicated.\" She said her classmates have not only shown these qualities in their success, but also in their friendships to each other.

He noted that it is the step that leads to either getting a job or heading off to college. \"I hope you go on to accomplish great things in your life,\" he said. However, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> went on to explain that accomplishments are relative, depending on how a person measures success. He explained that he had one friend in his life who finished school and decided he wanted to keep surfing, so he got a job making dentures, which gave him the time and the money to keep doing what he loved. However, he had another friend who went on to become the manager of a commercial real estate corporation in downtown <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>. Henry told the graduates that both men had accomplished success, just in different ways. \"Their motivations were very different,\" <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> said.", "He said his motivation was also different, taking him down a completely different path in life. Henry told those in attendance that at the age of 13 he received God's call in his life. From that point on he knew his life would be spent serving God. This meant that in college he went on to study religion and Greek, which he said led to spending hours and hours studying. \"I had that motivation and calling,\" he said. \"I was interested in learning.\" But, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> said he also recognized that he would have to balance all of his studying with other, more adventurous activities. He said he went on to take up everything from mountain climbing to skiing.", "Henry also found himself on the rowing team, where he met two people that would ultimately inspire him. He had two teammates, one very athletic guy who ultimately died of leukemia, and another unlikely rower, who was a cowboy from <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>. When one teammate died of leukemia, he asked the other to try out for the Olympic rowing team. <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> said not only did the cowboy say he would try out, but then he actually did it. He made the Olympic team and went on to become a rowing coach at one of the east coast colleges. Henry explained that it was because of a challenge God put in front of his teammate, that the unlikely rower went on to become an Olympic athlete. He said that one moment, when he promised his dying friend that he would try out for the team, ultimately changed his life. Henry then looked to Proverbs 3, which talks about the importance of trusting in <LOCATION>God</LOCATION>. \"As you trust God, he will show you the way,\" <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> said. He told the graduates that God will help them each plan their lives. \"Don't say no to surprise challenges that God may put in your path, because it will open avenues,\" <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> said.", "Henry concluded his sermon by asking God to bless all of the graduates of the class of <DATE>2004</DATE>. Wells then took the podium to charge the graduates, offering them challenges and things to think about in the coming days. He charged them to create a basis of belief, to listen to the prompting of the spirit and to serve their fellow man.

Alderwood will host Hanford in an opening round <ORGANIZATION>3A State</ORGANIZATION> tournament game this <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>5 p.m</TIME>.

School district staff members would have second dibs on the remaining spaces available in the center, which is located at the corner of Ninth Street and <LOCATION>Lincoln Avenue</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> said there are a few students who take advantage of the program, but mostly children of teachers are enrolled in the facility. \"What we do is a lot more than just child care,\" said <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON>. \"We've been able to provide that child care piece as well as pre-school.\"", "<ORGANIZATION>Washington Elementary School Vice</ORGANIZATION> Principal <PERSON>Diann Zavala</PERSON> has been researching pre-schools to see if the <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District</ORGANIZATION> is ready to provide pre-school instruction within the public schools.

The majority of the youths in the program are working on language development. \"The goal is to serve all those children who are not being served elsewhere,\" said <PERSON>Zavala</PERSON>.

In its second year the early learning center borrowed <MONEY>$100,000</MONEY>. Carrera said that some of the money lost in the program has been due to state regulations. One of the regulations is that for infants the adult to child ration must be 1 to 4. Carrera said when a fifth child is enrolled an additional full-time staff person must be hired. To take care of the problem infants have been enrolled in groupings of four. <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> said that children will be put on a waiting list until enough are enrolled to hire another teacher.", "The teachers at the early learning center are paid better and have benefits that are not available to teachers at other day cares, said <ORGANIZATION>Carrera</ORGANIZATION>. \"We expect more of them and we expect them to give our children better care,\" said <PERSON>Carrera</PERSON>.

Beginning with the class of <DATE>2006</DATE>, graduating seniors will need only 22 credits. The class of <DATE>2005</DATE> will still need 24 credits to receive a diploma, said Birr. Birr also touched on the non-credit graduation requirements of high school students. Students are required to submit a five-year education plan upon entering high school. Freshmen will not get their class agendas until the plan is submitted. The senior project will become a requirement of all high school students beginning with the class of <DATE>2006</DATE>. The class of <DATE>2005</DATE> will not be required to do a senior project as it is part of their assignment for their contemporary world problems course. Birr told the school board that starting with the class of <DATE>2006</DATE> even the Running Start students attending <ORGANIZATION>Yakima Valley Community College</ORGANIZATION> will have to complete a senior project. Currently, Running Start students aren't required to complete a senior project. Birr also touched on the name change for the Certificate of Mastery the incoming freshman class will have to obtain to receive a high school diploma. Birr said the certificate is now known as the <ORGANIZATION>Certificate of Academic Achievement</ORGANIZATION>. Under course requirements at the high school, students will have to have four credits of English, two credits of health/fitness, two credits of science, one credit of visual and performing arts and one credit of occupational/career and technical courses. Students will need to take one credit of world history, one credit of American history and one credit of contemporary world problems. Birr also told of how students can satisfy their half-credit for <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Northwest</ORGANIZATION> history by taking the course in the seventh grade instead of high school. High school students also need to take three credits of math or two credits of math if courses include algebra I or geometry. About the only major change in next year's high school course description book is under visual and performing arts. This class section used to be defined as fine arts. The new name eliminates some of the courses that fell under the fine arts program, such as debate. Classes that fall under the visual and performing arts include art, music, desktop publishing and commercial art/animation. Birr said next year's course description book is relatively the same as the previous year. He also noted the high school will be adding advanced placement biology next year. The high school now has nine advanced placement courses. The high school will become eligible for a special designation from colleges once it has 10 advanced placement classes. . <PERSON>John Panni</PERSON> can be contacted at (509) 837-4500, or email him at mPanni@hawkpress.com"]})

The <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School Board</ORGANIZATION> cleaned up some confusion at <TIME>last night</TIME>'s meeting concerning the purchase of a pair of vehicles for MSDR. <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District</ORGANIZATION> serves as the fiscal manager for the MSDR program. At <TIME>last night</TIME>'s meeting, the school board approved the bid from <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood's Tom Denchel Ford</ORGANIZATION> to purchase two <DATE>2004</DATE> Ford Taurus vehicles. MSDR will be leasing the vehicles from the school district. MSDR will pay the school district for all lease associated costs, such as maintenance. The issue goes back to the <DATE>February</DATE> school board meeting. At that meeting, school board members approved a request from MSDR Director <PERSON>Lee Campos</PERSON> to purchase a pair of Camrys from <ORGANIZATION>Toyota of Yakima</ORGANIZATION>. The bids from the <LOCATION>Yakima</LOCATION> dealership were <MONEY>$20,195</MONEY> for each vehicle, significantly higher than two other bids received. Tom <ORGANIZATION>Denchel Ford</ORGANIZATION> submitted in <DATE>February</DATE> a bid of <MONEY>$14,212</MONEY> per car for a <DATE>2004</DATE> Ford Taurus. At the <DATE>February</DATE> meeting, the board also received a bid of <MONEY>$13,429</MONEY> per car from <ORGANIZATION>Harris Ford Inc.</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lynnwood</LOCATION> for a Ford Taurus. The board went with the more expensive bid under the understanding it was because the MSDR needed the vehicles immediately. MSDR had received direction from the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction</ORGANIZATION> to purchase vehicles for its staff. Campos explained in <DATE>February</DATE> that his staff members were turning in high requests for mileage checks. MSDR staff members have been using their personal vehicles to travel across the state to track the educational progress of migrant students. The day following the <DATE>February</DATE> meeting, <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones</ORGANIZATION> halted the awarding of the bid until he could clarify some issues surrounding the board's decision. Bones was unable to be in attendance at the <DATE>February</DATE> meeting because of personal reasons. Under state law, a governing body using taxpayer dollars has to go with the most conservative bid presented to them unless they can properly justify the reason for going with a higher bid. At a special board meeting on <DATE>March 10</DATE>, Bones suggested the board reject all bids submitted at the <DATE>February</DATE> meeting and readvertise the process. Bones said he felt the bid specifications weren't as specific as they could have been. Bones told the board he wanted the specifications to outline more what the district was looking for. This time around, <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School District Executive Director of Business Dave Plesha</ORGANIZATION> suggested the board go with the bid from <ORGANIZATION>Tom Denchel Ford</ORGANIZATION>. Plesha said Denchel officials told him they could have the vehicles available in the next few days. Plesha said <PERSON>Denchel</PERSON> originally told him it would be up to 45 days before the vehicles could be delivered. The school board actually went with the state bid amount submitted by <ORGANIZATION>Harris Ford Inc</ORGANIZATION> of <MONEY>$13,773</MONEY> per <ORGANIZATION>Ford Taurus</ORGANIZATION>. The catch is that Denchel agreed to match the state bid, which board members approved. The original state bid amount was <MONEY>$11,753</MONEY> per vehicle before taxes. The amount rose with the addition of fees for daytime running lights and a 60/40 split fold rear seat. Following license and title fees the final bid amount increased to <MONEY>$13,773</MONEY> per vehicle. Denchel agreed to provide all the items that were included in the state bid. Some of the items that will be featured in the two Taurus cars include side-impact door beams, power front disc and rear drum brakes, air bags, fabric cloth seats, sunglass holder, outside temperature gauge and digital clock, power windows, air conditioning, remote keyless entry with trunk release, cruise control and deluxe AM/FM/Cassette/CD audio with six speakers. <ORGANIZATION>Alderwood School Board</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Fred Kilian</PERSON> said he was glad to see the district accept the best offer for the vehicles. <PERSON>Kilian</PERSON> said the savings will prove out in the long run for the school district."]})

The legislation allows student to have at least four opportunities to retake portions of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Assessment of Student Learning (<ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION>) by the time new graduation requirements take effect for the class of <DATE>2008</DATE>. \"Retakes for the <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION> is going to be helpful for many of the youngsters here in <LOCATION>Alderwood</LOCATION>,\" said <PERSON>Carrera</PERSON>. He added that a recent federal decision makes it so that students who don't have English as their primary language and aren't enrolled in school continuously don't have to take the <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION>. Carrera said they will be encouraged to take the state test, but their scores will not count against the schools. Chase added that allowing students to take the <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION> more than once is \"a good thing.\"", "The Office of the <ORGANIZATION>Superintendent of Public Instruction</ORGANIZATION> is also authorized to more ahead with plans to design an additional assessment option for students who have the necessary skills, but experience difficulty demonstrating those abilities on the <ORGANIZATION>WASL</ORGANIZATION>. Also approved by the legislature was SB 6311, which will allow districts to set their levy base using the amount they would have collected if I-728 and 732 had been fully funded. Touted as a financial boost to many school districts, <ORGANIZATION>Chase</ORGANIZATION> said the legislation won't help students in the <LOCATION>Lower Valley</LOCATION> at all.", "\"We never ask for the full amount we can levy,\" said Chase, adding that most schools in the <LOCATION>Lower Valley</LOCATION> don't ask for full levy funding. \"The only people that are going to benefit are those in rich districts like <LOCATION>Bellevue</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mercer Island</LOCATION>, where people live who can afford the full levy,\" said Chase. Carrera agreed that the levy changes wouldn't help small, impoverished districts. Chase added that there was an effort to do away with levy equalization, which allows small districts to receive the same amount of money as larger districts. He said there has already been an effort to cut funding to schools. Last year about <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> was cut, and it was not reinstated this year. \"We don't know the full fiscal effects of the new legislation,\" said Chase. Also part of the legislature were policy bills that are expected to enhance the overall health and safety of students. The bills deal with preventing and resolving sexual misconduct cases, enhancing physical activity and improving student nutrition. There will also be increased access to school meals for low-income students and helping prevent child abduction.", "Changes were also made to the state's Learning Assistance Program (LAP). LAP funds can be used for programs for 11th grade students and starting in <DATE>2008</DATE> they can be used for 12th grade students under the new rules. \"They used to limit the grades that could be served by the LAP,\" said Chase. He is unsure of how the expansion will affect school budgets.

The two Republican state representatives joined their cohorts in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> <DATE>today</DATE> for the <DATE>2004</DATE> session.", "This year's gathering in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> for the state's elected officials will be a short 60-day session. Both men say much work must be crammed into the short period of time. Besides trying to thwart the attempts of Gov. <PERSON>Gary Locke</PERSON> to siphon money from the state's reserve funds, <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> and Chandler say legislators' plates will be filled this year with several issues that need to be addressed immediately. One of those issues is reforming the state's medical malpractice guidelines. Both Alderwood area legislators say the current costs of malpractice insurance, in terms of both premiums and settlements, are bankrupting the medical profession and driving physicians out of the state. \"It's at a point of total meltdown,\" said <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON>, presently serving his first term in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION>. \"We're losing doctors, especially in our smaller communities. \"Right now there are 21 doctors in <LOCATION>Yakima County</LOCATION> who can't get malpractice insurance. It's either too expensive or it's not offered,\" he said. Newhouse and <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> explain that one of the reasons the premiums for medical malpractice insurance are not affordable is because claims are so high. The two political allies say caps must be implemented on all medical malpractice claims. \"One of the ideas being talked about is assigning an amount of responsibility,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. In essence, that means setting a percentage or a ceiling on the amount of money a claimant could collect. Newhouse and <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> are quick to point out that advocates of this idea aren't trying to limit the insurance payout to people who successfully file claims for such things as actual medical bills and time lost from work. \"What we're talking about is a pain and suffering cap,\" said <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON>, explaining that instead of <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> being awarded by courtroom juries, a more sensible ceiling for such settlements might fall in the <MONEY>$250,000</MONEY> range. Newhouse is a sitting member of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> judiciary committee, which ensures that at the very least the topic of medical malpractice reform will be addressed this session.", "Also apt to be tossed around in legislative chambers this session, say <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>, is the issue of health care costs. \"We've had double-digit growth in health care costs for several years,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. \"Health care costs are affecting everyone...business, you and me, state government.\" Changes that are needed, say the two legislators, include Medicaid reimbursement rate adjustments, redefining small group insurance rates and having more flexibility in insurance coverages. Reforming the way the state adjudicates water rights is bound to come up in discussions in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> this session, too. The two men said the state's \"use it or lose it\" measure needs to be changed so that farmers and ranchers aren't penalized for not using irrigation water. \"After all, if you don't need irrigation water one season and you leave water in the stream, it's benefiting fish,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. Under current state law, those holding water rights must give up their water to the state if they haven't utilized their rights for five successive years. Reform to the state's <ORGANIZATION>Department of Labor and Industries</ORGANIZATION> division is also badly needed, say both <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Newhouse</ORGANIZATION>. \"We need to look at how the L&I trust fund is managed,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. \"And, L&I has to do a better job at getting people back to work. \"Accountability is needed-both in minimizing fraud and in doing a better job of getting people's claims approved in a more timely manner,\" he added. Newhouse and <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> said they are also unhappy with the news that <PERSON>Locke</PERSON>, who is giving up his seat as governor this <DATE>fall</DATE>, has indicated that his supplemental budget will draw down the surplus funds that have been stored away by legislators.", "\"<PERSON>Locke</PERSON> is abandoning the (budgetary) principles that were established last year,\" said <PERSON>Newhouse</PERSON>. He and <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> went on to explain that <PERSON>Locke</PERSON> is proposing to expand on the state's existing programs, in areas such as increasing the enrollment counts at state universities. \"If we deplete our reserves and abandon our budget approach, it will make for more difficult times,\" said <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON>. \"What's being proposed in this supplemental budget will amount to a <MONEY>$1 billion</MONEY> deficit.\" Both men say now is not the time to put <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> state into further economic peril. They said the sound financial principles that were adhered to in last year's legislative session need to be continued this session, in hopes that the state's economic climate continues to rebound."]})
